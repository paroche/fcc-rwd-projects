<p>This title has its keyword a little further up, but it&rsquo;s still within the length limit, so it&rsquo;s going to be visible in any SERP. We can see the page is going to be a guide, because the title says how to, and we can see it&#39;s fresh because
  it contains the current year.</p>

<h4>Brand in a title</h4>

<p>In case you have a well-known brand, it is a good idea to use it in the title. When users skim the results page, they will be more likely to choose something they recognize.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an established brand, you will not see any immediate benefit from including it in the title. But, it may help you to build brand recognition over time, so you will start seeing the benefits eventually. We are talking years.</p>

<h2 id="anchor4">2. Meta description tag</h2>

<p>Meta description is a short paragraph of text used to describe your page in search results. In HTML, a meta description tag looks like this:</p>

<div class="code-block"><code class="code">&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Your description goes here&quot;&gt;</code></div>

<p>While in SERP it looks like this:</p>

<div class="g_width-sm"><noscript><img class="img-width" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/snippet%20title%20(2).png" srcset="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/snippet-title-(2)-473x.png 473w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/snippet-title-(2)-723x.png 723w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/snippet-title-(2)-973x.png 973w" width="973" height="301" alt="" decoding="async" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 223px, (max-width: 723px) 473px, 973px"></noscript>
  <img class="img-width lazyload" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/snippet%20title%20(2).png" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201800%201818%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="973"

    data-sizes="(max-width: 473px) 223px, (max-width: 723px) 473px, 973px"></div>

<h3>SEO value</h3>

<p>The function of meta description is similar to the title. It provides a little more detail about your page and it helps users decide whether to visit your page or not.</p>

<p>Though meta description is not a direct ranking factor, it can still help your success in search. If your meta description is relevant and attractive, more users will click on your snippet, and, eventually, Google might consider giving you a better ranking
  position.
</p>

<p>Although, same as with titles, Google reserves the right to rewrite your meta description. In fact, it happens very often &mdash; most meta descriptions you see in SERP have been created by Google and not by website owners.</p>

<p>As explained by John Mueller, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo2qthtQTYw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=29m40s" target="_blank">meta descriptions are frequently adjusted</a> to match even the slightest change in the user&rsquo;s query. So, Google
  is actually doing you a favor. It shows different meta descriptions to different users and improves the relevance of your search snippets.</p>

<h3>How to optimize</h3>

<p>Even though meta descriptions are often rewritten by Google, there is still a fair share of original descriptions shown in SERP. Don&rsquo;t leave it up to chance, don&rsquo;t rely on Google to generate your meta description for you, because it might
  not. And if it doesn&rsquo;t you are left with a poorly optimized snippet and poor performance in search.</p>

<h4>Meta description length</h4>

<p>There is no technical limit on the length of the meta description, but Google will generally show only the first 160 characters in your snippet. The advice is the same as with the title tag &mdash; make it however long you want, but make sure that your
  keywords and other important information are mentioned closer to the beginning.</p>

<p>You can check out your meta descriptions in <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/website-auditor/" target="_blank">WebSite Auditor</a>. In your project, go to <em>Site Structure &gt; Site Audit &gt; On-page</em>, and see if any of your meta descriptions
  exceed recommended length.</p>

<h4>Meta description keywords</h4>

<p>There is more room in a meta description, so it&rsquo;s ok to use more than one keyword. Current best practice is to use variations of the keyword you&rsquo;ve placed in the title.</p>

<p>For example, if my title is <em>How to Choose the Best Laptop for Work</em>, then in my description, instead of saying <em>laptop for work</em> I&rsquo;ll say <em>business laptops</em>. This way I&rsquo;m covering more ground and there is a better chance
  of matching the user&rsquo;s query exactly.</p>

<p>Even though you can use more keywords in the description, it is recommended not to use more than two or three. Keep it natural, don&rsquo;t go out of your way to fit one more keyword where it doesn&rsquo;t belong.</p>

<h4>No quotation marks in meta description</h4>

<p>When you use double quotation marks in the HTML of meta description, Google will cut this text at the quotation mark when displaying it in SERPs. Thus, it is better to remove all the alphanumeric characters from your meta descriptions.</p>

<h2 id="anchor5">3. Headings</h2>

<p>Headings (H1-H2) are used to split your page into sections or chapters. Each heading is like a small title within the page. In HTML, a heading looks like this:</p>

<div class="code-block"><code class="code">&lt;h1&gt;Your heading goes here&lt;/h1&gt;</code></div>

<p>While on the page they look something like this:</p>

<div class="g_width-sm"><noscript><img class="img-width" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/headings.png" srcset="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/headings-400x.png 400w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/headings-650x.png 650w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/headings-900x.png 900w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/headings-1150x.png 1150w" width="1150" height="831" alt="" decoding="async" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 150px, (max-width: 650px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 650px, 1150px"></noscript>

    data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 150px, (max-width: 650px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 650px, 1150px"></div>

<h3>SEO value</h3>

<p>The initial function of headings was to improve user experience. When the page is properly organized with headings, users have easier time navigating the content, skipping irrelevant chapters, and finding the important stuff. And if the users are happy
  &mdash; Google is happy.</p>

<p>Today, the role of headings is much more advanced. Since the introduction of passage indexing, Google can use certain sections of your page as a separate search result.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you have written a guide about <em>removing plaster from a brick wall</em>. And you&rsquo;ve used proper headings to split your guide into chapters: <em>prep the room, remove plaster, brush the brick, wash the brick, </em>and<em> seal the brick</em>.
  Now, if someone asks Google how to seal an exposed brick wall, Google will be able to take one of your chapters and present it as a separate search result.</p>

<p>Effectively, if your headings are optimized for search, each of them is eligible to become a separate search result. It&rsquo;s basically like having pages within pages.</p>

<h3>How to optimize</h3>

<p>Here are the best practices to follow when optimizing headings:</p>

<h4>Headings hierarchy</h4>

<p>Traditionally, there is only one H1 heading per page and it&rsquo;s the title of your page. It&rsquo;s not the same as the title tag though. The title tag is shown in search results, while the H1 heading is shown on your website. One real difference is
  that there is no character limit for the H1 heading, so you can make it longer than your title tag. Or you can make them the same. Up to you.</p>

<p>Then there are H2 headings, which are used to split your content into chapters. Then H3 headings, which are used to split your chapters into sub-chapters. And you can follow the same logic as far as H6, but it&rsquo;s generally not recommended going beyond
  H3-H4. The pages with many heading levels become too messy.</p>

<h4>Headings keywords</h4>

<p>Remember how each of your headings can be a separate search result? To make this possible, you have to write each heading as if it were a page title. Include a keyword that is relevant to the section of the page and phrase your heading in a query-like
  fashion.
</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s go back to our brick wall guide. On the left, we&rsquo;ve got headings that are not optimized for search. They work fine for navigation within the page, but they will never make it to SERP. Whereas on the right, we&rsquo;ve got
  headings that are much more informative and can be used by Google to answer narrow search queries.</p>

<div class="g_width-sm table_widget">
  <table class="table">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Bad headings</th>
        <th>Good headings</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Removing</td>
        <td>Expose the brick with a chisel</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Brushing</td>
        <td>Clean exposed brick with a brush</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Washing</td>
        <td>Wash the brick with a soapy solution</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sealing</td>
        <td>Seal the brick with a matte sealant</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<h4>Parallel syntax</h4>

<p>Sometimes Google can take your headings and make them into a list-type featured snippet. In order to make your headings eligible for a list snippet, they have to follow parallel syntax. It means all of your headings have to be phrased similarly, for example,
  all of them have to start with a verb, or all of them have to be noun phrases. It also helps if all of the same-level headings are of similar length and arranged in a numbered list:</p>

<div class="g_width-sm"><noscript><img class="img-width" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/list.png" srcset="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/list-446x.png 446w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/list-696x.png 696w" width="696" height="385" alt="" decoding="async" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 196px, 696px"></noscript>
  <img class="img-width lazyload" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/list.png" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201800%201818%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="696" height="385" alt=""

    data-sizes="(max-width: 446px) 196px, 696px"></div>

<h2 id="anchor6">4. Alt attribute</h2>

<p>The alt text attribute is a part of an image tag, and it provides a description for an image. In HTML it may look like this:</p>

<div class="code-block"><code class="code">&lt;img src=&quot;url&quot; alt=&quot;Your image description goes here&quot;&gt;</code></div>

<h3>SEO value</h3>

<p>Alt text plays a major role in image optimization. It makes your images accessible both to search engines (by telling them what a particular image means) and to people (by displaying an alternative text in case a particular image cannot be loaded or by
  helping screen readers convey images).</p>

<p>The main benefit in terms of search optimization is that optimized alt texts will help your images rank in image search. And although artificial intelligence has gotten pretty good at reading images, a written description helps bridge the remaining gap.</p>

<h3>How to optimize</h3>

<p>Here are the best practices to follow when optimizing alt texts:</p>

<h4>Don&rsquo;t leave them empty</h4>

<p>If you want to use this additional opportunity to rank higher by means of image optimization, then first of all, check for empty alt texts. Open your <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/website-auditor/" target="_blank">WebSite Auditor</a> project,
  go to <em>Site Structure &gt; Site Audit</em>, and pay attention to the Images section.</p>

<div class="g_width-sm">&nbsp;</div>

<h4>Prioritize</h4>

<p>If you have thousands of images, you do not have to optimize each one (PHEW!). Pay attention to those that convey some useful data, not the ones that are used for entertainment and decoration. The useful images are images of products, screenshots of processes,
  your logo, infographics, diagrams, etc.</p>

<h4>Add keywords</h4>

<p>Alt texts are one more opportunity to use your target keywords. And you know the drill &mdash; do not overuse them! Write the description that provides context to your content and use a keyword where it is suitable. Keyword-optimized images will work
  great in combination of the factors that search engines take into account when ranking pages.</p>

<h2 id="anchor7">5. Open Graph tags</h2>

<p><a href="http://ogp.me/" target="_blank">Open Graph</a> (OG) tags are placed in the &lt;head&gt; section of a page and allow any webpage to become a rich object in social networks. It was first introduced by Facebook in 2010 and further recognized by
  other major social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)</p>

<p>In HTML, it can look like this:</p>

<div class="code-block"><code class="code">&lt;meta name=&quot;og:title&quot; property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;Your Open Graph Title Goes Here&quot;&gt;</code></div>

<h3>SEO value</h3>

<p>OG tags let you control how the information about your page is represented when shared via social channels. This possibility may help you enhance the performance of your links on social media, thus driving more click-throughs and increasing conversions.</p>

<h3>How to optimize</h3>

<p>There are quite a few Open Graph tags, I will give a few tips on the most important ones.</p>

<h4>OG title&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s another tag with the title of your page. So now you have three different titles: one is for search (title tag), one is for your website (H1), and&nbsp; the third one is for social networks (OG title). You can copy any of the other titles
  and keep things simple or you can come up with a separate title for social sharing.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that it should be between 60-90 characters, otherwise, it may be truncated.</p>

<h4>OG type</h4>

<p>Use this tag to describe what kind of object you are sharing: a website, post, video, company, etc. You can check the <a href="http://ogp.me/#types" target="_blank">complete list here</a>.</p>

<p>This tag is considered important when your page has the Like button. It may help to determine whether your content will appear in the Facebook user&#39;s interest section in case she or he &quot;Likes&quot; it.</p>

<p>In most cases, the type is &quot;website&quot;, because you mostly share links to websites. If so, you do not need to specify the type in the code, it will be read as such by default.</p>

<h4>OG description</h4>

<p>This one is very similar to the meta description tag. However, it won&#39;t be displayed in SERPs, it will be shown as the summary when your page is shared. For this reason, there is no point in craftily sneaking your keywords into this particular description.</p>

<p>Your main task here is to make it speak to your potential audience and drive more clicks.</p>

<p>As for the length, it is considered to be a good practice to keep it about 200 characters.</p>

<h4>OG image</h4>

<p>An image will make your shareable link much more attractive. Some text over the image is acceptable, but try to place it in the middle of an image, as some platforms will trim the edges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recommended resolution for the OG image is 1200x627 pixels, the size &mdash; up to 5MB.</p>

<p>Once you are done with your OG meta tags, you can check how everything looks like with the help of <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/" target="_blank">Open Graph Object Debugger</a>, a tool created by Facebook.</p>

<h4>Twitter cards</h4>

<p>Twitter cards are very similar to OG tags (title, description, image, etc.), but they are used exclusively by Twitter. Though now tweets can exceed 140 characters, these cards are a nice extension that allows your tweet to stand out in the crowd of common
  text tweets.</p>

    data-sizes="(max-width: 446px) 196px, 696px"></div>

<p>There are a few types of twitter cards out there:</p>

<p><strong>Summary card. </strong>Apart from the original tweet, there is a preview of your page&#39;s content, which is good for highlighting blog posts, products, news, etc.<br />
  <br /> Title: 70 chars<br /> Description: 200 chars<br /> Image: 120x120px, up to 1MB</p>

<p><strong>Summary card with a large image.</strong> This card is similar to the previous one, but it contains a larger image. The image can also include some text that conveys the main point of your page&#39;s content, a call to action, or something really
  provoking to click.<br />
  <br /> Title: 70 chars<br /> Description: 200 chars<br /> Image: 280x150px, up to 1MB</p>

<p><strong>Player cards.</strong> Such cards enable users to play videos or audios within a tweet.<br />
  <br /> Description: 200 chars<br /> Video: H.264, baseline profile, level 3.0, up to 640 x 480 pixels at 30fps.<br /> Audio: AAC, Low Complexity Profile</p>

<p><strong>App cards. </strong>Such cards enable users to download mobile apps right from a tweet. They feature a name, a description, an icon, a rating, and a price.<br />
  <br /> Title: rendered from app ID<br /> Description: 200 chars<br /> Image: rendered from app ID</p>

<h2 id="anchor8">6. Robots tag</h2>

<p>A robots tag is an element in the HTML of a page that informs search engines which pages on your site should be indexed and which should not. Its functions are similar to robots.txt, but robots.txt gives suggestions. Whereas robots tags give instructions.</p>

<p>In HTML, it can look like this:</p>

<div class="code-block"><code class="code">&lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;index, follow&quot;&gt;</code></div>

<h3>SEO value</h3>

<p>It is not that a robots tag may help you boost your rankings, but you can use it to save your rankings in case you have to block some pages from indexing.</p>

<p>For example, you can have some pages with rather thin content that you are not interested in being indexed in search, but which you would like to keep. In this case, you can just add a noindex tag for this page.</p>

<h3>How to optimize</h3>

<p>Here are the best practices to follow when optimizing robots tags:</p>

<h4>Address bots by name</h4>

<p>Use robots if you want to address all bots, but use individual bot names if you want to address a particular bot. Individual bot names are commonly used to ban malicious bots from crawling your website.</p>

<h4>Know your parameters</h4>

<p>Google understands and respects the following parameters in your robots tag:</p>

<p><em>Noindex</em> &mdash; prevents search engines from indexing a page;<br />
  <em>Nofollow </em>&mdash; prevents the search engine from following ALL the links on the page (that&#39;s why it is different from the nofollow attribute that is applied on an individual URL level);<br />
  <em>Follow </em>&mdash; links on the page should be follow even if the page is noindex;<br />
  <em>Noimageindex</em> &mdash; images on this page will not be indexed;<br />
  <em>Noarchive </em>&mdash; prevents a cached copy of the page from appearing in search results;<br />
  <em>None </em>&mdash; the same as &quot;noindex, nofollow&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that Google understands any combinations of lowercase and uppercase letters that you use for your robots tag parameters.</p>

<h2 id="anchor9">7. Canonical tag</h2>

<p>When you have a few pages with identical content, you can use a canonical tag to tell search engines which page should be prioritized.</p>

<p>In HTML, it may look like this:</p>

<div class="code-block"><code class="code">&lt;link href=&quot;URL&quot; rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt;</code></div>

<h3>SEO value</h3>

<p>A canonical tag is important for SEO in two ways.</p>

<p><strong>First of all, it saves you from having duplicate content.</strong> Duplicate content is not necessarily bad, but it might be suspicious. Google looks at your pages and they appear to be copies of some other pages &mdash; something fishy is going
  on.
</p>

<p><strong>Second, it prevents cannibalization. </strong>If you have two similar pages and both of them get indexed &mdash; they begin competing with each other in search results. That&rsquo;s a drain both on your resources and your chances of ranking.</p>

<h3>How to optimize</h3>

<p>Launch <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/website-auditor/" target="_blank">WebSite Auditor</a>, go to <em>Site Structure &gt; Site Audit</em>, and pay attention to the On-page section, namely to Duplicate titles and Duplicate meta descriptions.</p>

<p>In case you have a few URLs with identical content, specify a <em>&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt;</em> element in the page&#39;s HTML.</p>

<h2 id="anchor10">8. Schema markup</h2>

<p>Last, but not least, is <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/structured-data-for-seo.html" target="_blank">Schema markup</a>. Schema is actually a whole system of HTML tags. They can be added to your code to tell search engines about all kinds
  of things: your contact details, product prices, recipe ingredients, and much more.</p>

<h3>SEO value</h3>

<p>Schema markup is used to point out specific of information on a page and Google can use these pieces of information to create rich snippets. For example, if you apply Schema to a recipe page, Google will know the cooking time, the ingredients, the number
  of reviews, and even the calorie count of the recipe. And it will use the information to create these:</p>

<div class="g_width-sm"><noscript><img class="img-width" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/rich%20snippet.png" srcset="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/rich-snippet-450x.png 450w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/rich-snippet-700x.png 700w" width="700" height="324" alt="" decoding="async" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 200px, 700px"></noscript>
  <img class="img-width lazyload" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/rich%20snippet.png" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201800%201818%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="700" height="324"
    alt="" decoding="async" data-src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/rich%20snippet.png" data-srcset="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/rich-snippet-450x.png 450w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/rich-snippet-700x.png 700w"
    data-sizes="(max-width: 450px) 200px, 700px"></div>

<p>These are called rich snippets and, as you can see, they blow regular snippets out of the water. And Google has made more and more of these types of snippets available over the past few years. Today, we&rsquo;ve got article, product, event, book, movie,
  and about a dozen other schemas that can enhance your search appearance.</p>

<h3>How to optimize</h3>

<p>Schema can get a bit complicated and it&rsquo;s not something you can type out by hand. The best way to apply schema to a page is by using Structured Data Markup Helper. There, you can choose the type of Schema, enter your URL, and then simply select
  the text on the page and mark it up:</p>

<div class="g_width-sm"><noscript><img class="img-width" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/helper%202.png" srcset="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-453x.png 453w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-703x.png 703w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-953x.png 953w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-1203x.png 1203w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-1453x.png 1453w" width="1453" height="796" alt="" decoding="async" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 203px, (max-width: 703px) 453px, (max-width: 953px) 703px, (max-width: 1203px) 953px, 1453px"></noscript>
  <img class="img-width lazyload" src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/helper%202.png" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201800%201818%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="1453" height="796"
    alt="" decoding="async" data-src="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/upload/news/post/401/helper%202.png" data-srcset="https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-453x.png 453w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-703x.png 703w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-953x.png 953w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-1203x.png 1203w, https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumb/upload/news/post/401/helper-2-1453x.png 1453w"
    data-sizes="(max-width: 453px) 203px, (max-width: 703px) 453px, (max-width: 953px) 703px, (max-width: 1203px) 953px, 1453px"></div>

<div class="g_width-sm">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Once you are done, you can copy the code from the helper and onto your page.</p>

<h2 id="anchor11">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d say HTML tags are still pretty important for SEO, perhaps even more than before. And if I had to choose the most important HTML tags, I&rsquo;d definitely go with headings and Schema markup. Google is changing SERP quite rapidly, making it more
  interactive, and adding new types of snippets. To participate in all that, to remain competitive in search, you&rsquo;d have to start working on your headings and your rich results, like today.</p>
